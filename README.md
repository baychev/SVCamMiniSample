# SVCamMiniSample
SVS Vistek SVGenSDK version 2..3.1 example fixed to grab images with software trigger.

Modifications of original code:
- Fixed bug by setting acqTerminated=true in the constructor of SVCamAcquisition.
- Applied basic formatting (Ctrl+K+D) to improve readability.
- Added a method to save grabbed frame (creates a junk image at the moment).
